I got the courseupdate component wired up. Now I can click to travel back to the courses list. I still want to update the courses buttons because they aren't the same height. I also need to dig into the styles to figure out why the components are getting buttressed against the sides of thd screen and if the component actually does need to be wrapped in a form wrapper or not.

The next steps are going to be to set up a context provider with the <Provider> and <Consumer> tag for authentication in step 6. Also the delete course and return to list buttons aren't working and I need to set up their routes. The sign out and sign in components also aren't working the way I would expect them too.

I can't figure out the resizing on the tiles. Course list doesn't need to have a wrapper from the images
